Hey there! I'm Tom Lauerman, and I'm a software guy. I got my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science in 2021, and my development experience has mainly involved Android, iOS and a bit of web. My professional career includes a self-published app, work on Google Maps, and the ZipRecruiter mobile app. My free time includes gaming, Linux tinkering, rollerblading, and repeated failure to finish side-projects.

I have a particular fondness for mobile, and I especially enjoy creating compelling native experiences with an eye for the small details. I also greatly enjoy digging deep into the inner-workings of complex systems and poking around to see how things tick. The occasional programming language has also been known to catch my eye from time to time. If you find any of these things interesting, I'm sure you'll enjoy checking out some of the posts that I have planned.
