## About me

I'm a student at Trinity University with a passion for all things computer science. I've been taking courses in programming since my sophomore year at Frisco High school, and I haven't gone a single semester since then without taking a course that furthers my understanding of the field. Programming is an art, so I pride myself on coming up with creative solutions and implementing them with a fierce work ethic.
