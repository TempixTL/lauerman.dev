I'm a student at Trinity University with a passion for all things computer
science. I've been taking courses in programming since my sophomore year at
Frisco High school, and I haven't gone a single semester since then without
taking a course that furthers my understanding of the field. Programming is an
art, so I pride myself on coming up with creative solutions and implementing
them with a fierce work ethic.
