<h1 class="blue-accent">about me</h1>
<p>
My name is Thomas Lauerman and I’m a student at Trinity University with a
passion for all things computer science. I’ve been programming since I was a
kid, making animations and simple games on Scratch. As I kept expanding my
knowledge, little animations and games became web tools and mobile apps.
However, my drive remains the same: expressing my creativity, delighting users,
and making people’s lives easier.
