Welcome to the development repository of my personal website! 😁

The `dev` branch is used for all development, and the built site is deployed to the `master` branch.

This website was build with [React](https://reactjs.org), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) and a little bit of [Flare Animation](https://www.2dimensions.com/about-flare).
